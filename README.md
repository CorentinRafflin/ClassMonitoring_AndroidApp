# ClassMonitoring_AndroidApp
Code samples of an android application for teachers to monitor students. 
Disclaimer: the code might not be optimal nor clean as it was one of my first project using Java and haven't had many programming projects in the past. I haven't taken the time to refactor it before pushing it today 10/10/2020.
This is only a sample because the application might be used later by the school.

This was a school project with another student that lasted for six months from January 2018 to July 2018.
It was a project takeover so we didn't start from scratch, but we still built some things from scratch.
My coworker was mostly working on a PHP website, that is not in this repository, while I worked on the Android application.

This application (and the website) allows teachers to prepare the class details (time, students, groups, events and so on), observe several groups of students at a time, and get a summary of what happened in the class. The application can be synchronized with the website to use the preparation and review features.
